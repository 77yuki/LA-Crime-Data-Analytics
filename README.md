# Los Angeles Crime Data Analytics
The goal of this project is to provide current and prospective residents of Los Angeles with comprehensive and real-time information about crime rates in their city by designing an application. 
The application will utilize a dataset that contains crime data from Los Angeles in the year 2022. Utilizing this data, the application will display an interactive visual map with features that showcase important information such as areas in Los Angeles with the most crimes, the latest incidents and types of crimes. Users will be able to interact and explore with the map to learn about the safety of different neighbourhoods, gain details about specific crimes and identify crime trends. The overall aim of the application is to empower users to make informed decisions about their safety and residence based on the knowledge they gain from using it.
